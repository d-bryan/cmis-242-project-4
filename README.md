# Project 4 Instructions

The fourth programming project involves writing one program to manage 
a real estate database. This program should be comprised of an enumerated
type, an interface, and two parts. 

## Status Enum

The enumerated type should be named Status and should contain 
three enumeration literals, FOR_SALE, UNDER_CONTRACT and SOLD. 

## StatusChangeable Interface

The interface should be a generic interface named StatusChangeable and
it should have a bounded generic type parameter whose type must be an 
enumerated type. It should contain one abstract method changeStatus that 
has a parameter whose type is the generic type parameter.

## Property Class

The first part of the program is a class named Property. Among the 
processes are the implemented is the StatusChangeable interface. The 
elements for the property should contain variables:

1. The parcel id as integer
2. The property address stored as a string
3. The number of bedrooms stored as integer
4. The square footage stored as integer
5. The property price stored as integer
6. The status of the property whose type should be the enumerated type 
    Status with the equivalent integers of 0, 1, and 2.

### Property Methods

In addition, it should have the following three methods:

#### Constructor

- A constructor that accepts six parameters for the purpose of 
    initializing the characteristics of the property, specifically

    - Parcel id
    - Property address
    - Number of bedrooms
    - Square footage
    - Property price
    - Status

#### changeStatus Method

The status of the property should be set to FOR_SALE (0).

- A method named changeStatus that allows the status of the property 
    to be changed.
    
#### Overridden toString Method 
    
- An overridden toString method that returns a string containing the 
    parcel id, property address, number of bedrooms, square footage, 
    property price, and current status appropriately labeled.
    
## Program Core

### Program Core Methods

#### Main Method

The second part of the program is a Program Core and contains the 
main () method. 

### Static Variable for Property Class
- In addition, it should contain a class variable for 
    the Property class that defines the database of property records, 
    which is implemented as a HashMap, with the parcel id field (Integer) 
    as the key and a Property object as the value. 

- For consistency and feedback, there is a PRJ4Property.txt data file to 
    use with this project that contains all the data necessary to begin 
    the program. Directly read the data file (PRJ4Property.txt) into the 
    program and assign the values to the HashMap. `In the program the name 
    of the data file is entered with the relative path name, not the 
    absolute path. See Note at end of this document for clarification.` 
    For the documentation, a Transaction array is declared to hold the processing 
    implemented during the running of the program. Insert, delete, find, 
    and change status are the transaction during the processing of the 
    program. These are tags for each transaction followed by the 
    appropriate information about the transaction. So, the fields in the 
    Transaction array begin with the processing transaction, then the 
    parcel id and the remaining values in the HashMap.

### Displaying Output

The data file is read into the program and assigned into a HashMap. As 
each record is assigned, the program also displays the records of the 
data file using the toString() method in the IDE Output Window.

## Graphical User Interface

The program should generate the GUI shown below:

![GUI Image](./project-text-files/Picture1.png)

### Data Processing

The default process is Find. The default Change Status is FOR_SALE. 
Clicking the Process button should cause the selected choice of the 
three actions in the combo box to its right `Find, Insert, Delete` to 
be executed. When using the insert process to add a new property, the 
program should check for any non-integer values that may have been 
entered in any of the fields that require integers.<br/><br/>
`The following error messages should display in a JOptionPane window:`

### Error Handling

- After entering a number in the Parcel ID TextField if the number is 
    not in the database a message stating that fact is displayed. The 
    message should also display if the user clicks on the Process button 
    before any value is entered in the Parcel ID.
- When the Process button is clicked, the program checks that there is 
    an integer for the Parcel ID in the database. When the Insert 
    process is implemented, there is a check for integers in Bedrooms, 
    Square Footage, and Property Price TextFields. Each message 
    references to a specific TextField.
- If the user attempts to insert a Parcel ID, a key, that is already in 
    the database.
- If the user attempts to delete or find a record that is not in the 
    database. `Related to #1.`

### Success Handling

- After each successful operation is completed a JOptionPane window 
    displays confirming the success. 
- In the case of a successful Find request, a window should pop up 
    containing all the information in the associated Property object 
    using the toString() method.
- Clicking the Change Status button should cause status of the property 
    associated with the designated Parcel ID to be changed to status 
    selected in the combo box to its right. 
- The Change Status should be implemented any time there is a parcel 
    in the window. A JOptionPane window displays a confirmation of the 
    change.

<b>Include a Clear and an Exit button on the GUI Interface.</b>

## Recording User Activity

Each activity that the user performs is recorded in a Transaction array. 
The fields in the array include the transaction process, parcel id, 
property address, number of bedrooms, square footage, property price, 
and process/change of status activity.

## Upon Exit of Program

When the program ends, there are two displays of information displayed 
in the IDE Output Window: 

- The first set of data is the records in the Transaction array 
    displayed using the toString() method in the IDE Output Window 
    following the Transactions Completed tag. `For each process action 
    performed by the user, there is a transaction record.` 
- After the transactions, the second set of data display the newly 
    modified HashMap of the original set of data in the IDE Output Window 
    tagged as Modified Database displayed using the toString() method on 
    the Property objects. `See Outputâ€”edited below.`

## Programming Style

Be sure to follow good programming style, which means making all instance 
variables private, naming all constants, and avoiding the duplication of 
code. Furthermore, you must select enough different kinds of shapes to 
completely test the program.

### Absolute vs. Relative Path

<b>This is the absolute path:</b>

"C:\Users\Jones\Documents\CollegesUniversities\A UMUC\CMIS242\Assignments\Project 4\SPR 2020\PRJ4Property.txt"

<b>This is the relative path:</b>

"PRJ4Property.txt"
